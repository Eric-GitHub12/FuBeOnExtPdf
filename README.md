Created inteactive Fields with iText on an external PDF to track the progess of the testing.

An external PDF contains testing points.
The programm adds some interactive fields for every testing point.

During the testing, the interactiv fields are filed out in the PDF by the operator.

After the test, the programm parses the PDF an imports the comments from the interactive fields.
